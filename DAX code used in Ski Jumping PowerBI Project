--DAX code used for this particular project--

--CALCULATED COLUMNS--

--Creating calculated column using an IF formula that groups hill sizes into normal, large and flying hills based on hill size column
Hill Type = IF(all_hills[Hill size]<110, "Normal Hill", IF(all_hills[Hill size]<150, "Large Hill", "Flying Hill"))

--Creating month numbers based on date column using MONTH function
Month Number = MONTH(all_hills[Date].[Date])

--Creating seasons in which the competition was held based on the month number column
Season = IF(all_hills[Month Number]>10, "Winter", IF(all_hills[Month Number]<4, "Winter", "Summer"))

--Creating country abbreviation using the RIGHT function
Short = RIGHT(all_hills[Place],5)

Combining athlete's names into one column using the CONCATENATE function
Name = all_names[Name.4]&" "&all_names[Name.3]&" "&all_names[Name.2]&" "&all_names[Name.1]

--MEASURES--

--Creating measure of the longest jump based on a column of individual jump distances
Longest Jump = MAX(all_resultss[Distance])

--Creating measure of the max speed based on a column of speed results
Max Speed = MAX(all_resultss[Speed])

--Creating measure of the max wind based on the wind column
Max_Wind_Comp = MAX(all_resultss[Wind Comp])

--Creating measure of the min wind based on the wind column
Min_Wind_Comp = MIN(all_resultss[Wind Comp])

--Creating measure of the total jumps based on total amount of rows in all_resultss table using COUNTROWS function
Total Jumps = COUNTROWS(all_resultss)

--Creating measure of the total competitions amount based on distinct amount of rows in all_resultss table using DISTINCTCOUNT function
Total_Competitions = DISTINCTCOUNT(all_resultss[Id])

--Creating measure of the average temperature during competitions using AVERAGE function
Average Temperature = AVERAGE(all_stats[Air])
